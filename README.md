## About Me
Hi there! I'm Khang - a sophomore Computer Science student at Florida International University and passionate about Machine Learning and Software Engineering. I strive to create lasting impact in my community and inspire others to pursue their own journeys of curiosity and growth. Previously, I interned at State Farm as a Software Engineer, contributing to the Policy View team by building and improving software solutions for millions of users. Currently, I’m expanding my Machine Learning knowledge through research and hands-on projects.
