## About Me
Hi there! I'm Khang - a sophomore Computer Science student at Florida International University and passionate about Machine Learning and Software Engineering. I strive to create lasting impact in my community and inspire others to pursue their own journeys of curiosity and growth. Previously, I interned at State Farm as a Software Engineer, contributing to the Policy View team by building and improving software solutions for millions of users. Currently, I’m expanding my Machine Learning knowledge through research and hands-on projects.

## Experience
- **Applied Research Center- FIU** –  Undergraduate Research Assistant (Nov 2025 – Present)  
  - Incoming Fall 2025- AI/ML Researcher
  
- **State Farm** - Software Engineer Intern (May 2025 - Aug 2025)
  - Built a multi-agent application using OpenAI LLMs and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to automate repetitive UI testing, designing agents for test execution, data retrieval, and reporting.  
  - Improved GitLab CI/CD pipelines by adding automated validation stages, introducing parallel jobs, and refining deployment scripts to streamline production releases.  
  - Enhanced RESTful APIs on AWS Lambda by implementing fallback data handling, restructuring response logic, and refactoring 30+ unit tests to improve reliability and maintainability.  

- **INIT Build** – Backend Lead (Feb 2025 – May 2025)
  - Led a backend team of 4 in developing [DuelDot](https://github.com/CarlosMelicandia/DuelDot), a real-time 2D multiplayer shooter game.  
  - Designed core backend systems including game state synchronization, leaderboard logic, and minimap rendering with Node.js, Express.js, and Socket.IO.  
  - Worked closely with frontend developers to integrate gameplay mechanics and ensure smooth multiplayer performance.
